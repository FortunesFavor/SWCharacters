Powers
      
    	Battle Focus - 
    	Nix may make one extra attack in a round for every 5 stamina spent, to a total of her Maximum Stamina

	Opportunist - 
	For 5 stamina, Nix may make an attack against the scenery that will provide an advantage, such as shooting out the lights, or firing at a door to seal it before more enemies come in. This is in addition to any other attacks she makes that round

	Jetpack - 
	For 10 stamina per turn, Nix can deploy her jetpack, making her impossible to hit via melee, and giving a -2 penalty to anyone trying to shoot her. She takes no penalty for firing while in the air
